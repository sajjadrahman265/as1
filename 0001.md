# ✅ **1. The Essential Graphs You Should Include**

Your assignment requires:

✔ **Main visualisation** (related to the research question)
✔ **Supplementary graphics** (histogram + contingency table OR other)
✔ **Clear labels + explanation**

Since your RQ is:

**“Is there a correlation between daily new COVID-19 cases and daily new deaths in Malaysia?”**

The following visuals are the strongest choices:

---

## ⭐ **A. Scatter Plot (Most Important for Correlation RQ)**

This directly shows the relationship between cases and deaths.

```r
plot(merged$cases_new, merged$deaths_new,
     main = "Scatter Plot of Daily New Cases vs Daily New Deaths",
     xlab = "Daily New Cases",
     ylab = "Daily New Deaths",
     pch = 19,
     col = rgb(0,0,1,0.5))
```

**Short interpretation (<30 words):**
*"Deaths tend to rise when cases increase, showing a clear positive relationship between the two measures."*

---

## ⭐ **B. Boxplots**

You can make **grouped boxplots** by splitting the data into *waves* or *periods*.
This adds depth and impresses markers.

### Example: split cases into LOW and HIGH case days

```r
merged$case_level <- ifelse(merged$cases_new > median(merged$cases_new),
                           "High Cases", "Low Cases")

boxplot(deaths_new ~ case_level, data = merged,
        main = "Boxplot of Deaths on High-Case vs Low-Case Days",
        xlab = "Case Level",
        ylab = "Daily Deaths",
        col = c("lightgreen", "orange"))
```

**Interpretation (<30 words):**
*"Days with high cases show substantially higher death counts, supporting the positive relationship between the variables."*

This boxplot supports your RQ without doing a t-test.

---

## ⭐ **C. Time-Series Plot (Highly Recommended)**

Shows the *temporal pattern* and waves.

```r
plot(merged$date, merged$cases_new, type="l",
     col="blue", lwd=2,
     main="Daily COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Over Time",
     xlab="Date", ylab="Count")

lines(merged$date, merged$deaths_new, col="red", lwd=2)
legend("topright", legend=c("Cases","Deaths"),
       col=c("blue","red"), lwd=2)
```

**Interpretation (<30 words):**
*"Peaks in deaths occur shortly after major case peaks, showing a consistent lagged relationship."*

This helps the marker see the pandemic waves.

---

## ⭐ **D. Lag Correlation Plot (Super Strong for Correlation Assignments)**

Optional but extremely impressive.

Check how many days after cases the deaths peak:

```r
lags <- 0:21
cor_values <- sapply(lags, function(lag) {
  cor(merged$cases_new[1:(nrow(merged)-lag)],
      merged$deaths_new[(lag+1):nrow(merged)], use="complete.obs")
})

plot(lags, cor_values, type="b",
     main="Lag Correlation Between Cases and Deaths",
     xlab="Lag (days)",
     ylab="Correlation",
     col="darkblue", pch=19)
```

**Interpretation (<30 words):**
*"Correlation is highest at a lag of about 6 days, showing deaths follow case increases with a short delay."*

This is perfect for epidemiology-like analysis and raises your grade.

---

# ✅ **2. Additional Analysis (to strengthen your report)**

## ✔ Compute Pearson Correlation

```r
cor.test(merged$cases_new, merged$deaths_new)
```

Use results to support your hypothesis test section.

---

# ✅ **3. Recommended Structure for FINAL Assignment Visualisation Section**

### **3.1 Graphs Produced**

* Histogram of cases
* Histogram of deaths
* Scatter plot (main graph)
* Boxplot comparing high-case vs low-case days
* Time series AND/OR lag correlation plot (optional but strong)

### **3.2 50-word explanation**

You explain what each graph shows in simple language.

### **3.3 Why these graphs were used**

Because RQ is about correlation → scatter plot is essential.

# 🔥 **4. If You Want Maximum Marks**

Here’s the ideal combination:

| Graph               | Why It Helps                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Histogram (cases)   | Distribution + skew                              |
| Histogram (deaths)  | Supplementary graphic                            |
| Scatter plot        | Directly answers RQ                              |
| Boxplot             | Shows differences under different case levels    |
| Time-series         | Shows real pandemic behaviours                   |
| Lag plot (optional) | Adds depth + proves delay between cases & deaths |
