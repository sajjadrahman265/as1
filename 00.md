# ⭐ **Short Note: Why These Columns and Why This Research Question**

For this project, we selected the columns **cases_new**, **cases_unvax**, **cases_fvax**, and **cases_boost** because they directly relate to vaccination status, which is the focus of our study. These variables are continuous and change over time, making them suitable for statistical analysis. We did not include the partially vaccinated column because it contains long periods of zero values and does not provide useful variation for testing. We also removed cases_active because it is not a vaccination measure and is calculated from other values, which could affect the analysis.

From the assignment guidelines, our research question had to be one of three types:
(1) difference in means,
(2) difference in proportions, or
(3) correlation between two continuous measures.

Because our dataset contains continuous numerical variables and does not have clear groups for comparing means or proportions, options (1) and (2) were not suitable. Therefore, we selected **Type 3: correlation between continuous measures**. This allows us to examine whether changes in unvaccinated, fully vaccinated, and booster cases are related to changes in **cases_new**, which fits the assignment requirements.

Based on this, our correlation tests include:

* correlation between **cases_new** and **cases_unvax**
* correlation between **cases_new** and **cases_fvax**
* correlation between **cases_new** and **cases_boost**

These choices match the assignment instructions and support a clear and testable hypothesis.
