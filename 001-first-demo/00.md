# **1. Introduction**

---

## **1.1 Problem statement and research motivation (≈100 words)**

COVID-19 created many waves of infection in Malaysia, and during these waves the number of daily new cases and daily deaths changed quickly. Understanding how these two measures relate to each other is important because it helps explain how the situation developed over time. If daily cases rise and deaths rise shortly after, this information can be useful for public health planning. In this project, two official datasets from the Ministry of Health were combined to study the relationship between daily new cases and daily new deaths. By analysing this connection, we aim to understand how strongly the rise in infections is linked to later increases in deaths.

---

## **1.2 The dataset (≈75 words)**

Two datasets were used: **cases_malaysia_clean.csv** and **deaths_malaysia.csv**. Both contain daily national data from 2020 onwards. From the cases file, only *date* and *cases_new* were selected. From the deaths file, *date* and *deaths_new* were chosen. The two datasets were merged using the date column, resulting in a combined dataset with **1,251 matched days**. This smaller dataset is clean, easy to analyse, and directly supports the research question about the relationship between cases and deaths.

---

## **1.3 Research question (≈50 words)**

**RQ:** *Is there a significant correlation between daily new COVID-19 cases and daily new deaths in Malaysia?*

This research question helps us examine whether increases in infections are followed by increases in deaths. Understanding this relationship shows how the pandemic evolved and whether daily infections can predict later outcomes.

---

## **1.4 Null and alternative hypotheses (≈100 words)**

Pearson correlation and linear regression were used to test the research question.

**H0 (Null Hypothesis):** There is **no significant correlation** between daily new cases and daily new deaths.
**H1 (Alternative Hypothesis):** There **is a significant correlation** between daily new cases and daily new deaths.

If the p-value from the correlation test is below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Lag analysis was also used to check whether deaths tend to follow cases after several days, which is common for COVID-19 because deaths happen some days after infection. This supports a more realistic understanding of the relationship.

# **2. Background Research**

---

## **2.1 Review of research papers (≈200 words)**

Several studies around the world have shown a strong relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths. Many papers report that when infections rise sharply, deaths tend to increase a few days or weeks later. For example, studies from Europe and the United States found that daily deaths usually follow cases with a delay of about 5–14 days. This is because deaths often occur after the illness becomes severe.

Research also shows that death numbers depend on other factors such as age, vaccination levels, and healthcare capacity. However, even with these factors, the basic pattern remains: higher case numbers often lead to higher death numbers. Some studies also use lagged correlation methods, similar to what we applied, to find the delay between rising cases and rising deaths.

Although many papers examine these trends in different countries, fewer studies focus specifically on Malaysia using daily national-level data. By analysing the Malaysian dataset directly, we can check whether the same international patterns appear in this country. This helps confirm whether the relationship between cases and deaths is similar to what other researchers found.

---

## **2.2 Why the RQ is of interest (≈100 words)**

The research question is important because cases and deaths are the two most watched indicators during the pandemic. Understanding their relationship tells us whether rising cases can act as an early warning for future increases in deaths. This is useful for forecasting, health planning, and creating public awareness. Since Malaysia experienced several waves with different variants, studying the correlation helps to understand whether these waves behaved similarly or differently. This analysis also adds value because it is based on real daily data rather than general reports or assumptions.

---

# **3. Visualisation**

---

## **3.1 Appropriate graphs (≈50 words)**

Several graphs were produced to understand the data. A histogram for daily cases and a histogram for daily deaths show how values are distributed. A scatter plot shows the direct relationship between cases and deaths. A time-series plot displays how both measures changed over time. A lag-correlation plot helps identify the delay between cases and deaths.

---

## **3.2 Additional information (≈50 words)**

The histograms show strong right-skewed distributions, meaning most days had low numbers but some days had extremely high values during major waves. The time-series graph shows clear peaks where cases and deaths rise close together. The scatter plot shows that higher case numbers generally match higher death numbers.

---

## **3.3 Useful information (≈50 words)**

The visuals confirm that the dataset is suitable for correlation analysis. The pattern in the scatter plot suggests a positive relationship between cases and deaths. The lag plot shows the strongest correlation appears when cases lead deaths by about 6 days, which supports the realistic time delay between infection and severe outcomes.

---

# **4. Analysis**

---

## **4.1 Statistical test used (≈75 words)**

Pearson correlation was selected because both variables (cases and deaths) are continuous and measured daily. This test shows how strongly the two variables move together. A simple linear regression was also used to check whether daily cases can statistically predict daily deaths. A lag analysis from 0 to 21 days helped find the most meaningful delay between cases and deaths, providing a deeper understanding of their relationship.

---

## **4.2 Hypothesis test result (≈100 words)**

The Pearson correlation without lag was **r = 0.685**, with a **p-value < 2.2e-16**, which is far below 0.05. This means daily cases and daily deaths are significantly positively correlated. Lag analysis found the strongest correlation at **lag = 6 days (r ≈ 0.70)**, suggesting deaths typically rise around six days after cases increase. The regression model also showed a significant positive effect (p < 0.001). Because the statistical tests are highly significant, we **reject the null hypothesis** and accept that a meaningful relationship exists between cases and deaths.

---

# **5. Evaluation – Group Experience**

---

## **5.1 What went well (≈75 words)**

Our group successfully cleaned both datasets and merged them by date. Once the data was organised, creating visualisations and running statistical tests became much easier. Communication improved as the project progressed, and everyone contributed ideas on selecting the research question. The results from the analysis were clear and matched what we expected based on real COVID-19 trends.

---

## **5.2 Points for improvement (≈75 words)**

At the beginning, we found it challenging to understand which features to keep and how to merge two datasets correctly. Some group members were also new to R, so simple tasks took extra time. In the future, we could start earlier, practise coding sooner, and divide responsibilities more clearly. Learning more about correlation and regression beforehand would also improve confidence.

---

## **5.3 Group’s time management (≈50 words)**

Time management was average. Some parts were delayed because we changed the research question after reviewing the dataset. However, once tasks were divided, work progressed more smoothly. Regular discussions helped us stay organised.

---

## **5.4 Project’s overall judgement (≈50 words)**

The project was successful. We produced clean data, meaningful visualisations, and correct statistical tests. The results clearly answered the research question and showed a strong link between daily cases and deaths.

---

## **5.5 Changes to group**

*(No changes.)*

---

## **5.6 Comment on GitHub log (≈50 words)**

The GitHub log shows steady progress throughout the project. Each commit reflected important steps such as data cleaning, merging files, creating graphs, and running analysis. This demonstrates good teamwork and an organised workflow.

---

# **6. Conclusions**

---

## **6.1 Results explained (≈75 words)**

The results show a clear and significant relationship between daily new cases and daily new deaths in Malaysia. When cases increase, deaths also tend to rise shortly after. The strongest relationship appears at a six-day delay, which fits the typical time between infection and severe outcomes. This confirms that cases can act as an early indicator of potential increases in deaths.

---

## **6.2 Interpretation of results (≈75 words)**

These findings match global research showing that rises in infections are followed by rises in deaths. The positive correlation shows that daily cases can help predict changes in deaths, although not perfectly because many factors affect fatality risk. The lag effect supports the medical timeline of COVID-19 progression. Overall, the results suggest that monitoring case trends is important for early preparation.

---

## **6.3 Limitations and future work (≈50 words)**

This study only used two variables: daily cases and daily deaths. Other factors such as age, vaccination, variants, and testing levels were not included. Future research could add more variables or use advanced models to create better predictions.
